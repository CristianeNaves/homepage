# OBF site redesign plans

## Goal

Modernise the current site design, including the OBF logo, for a more professional front, 
allowing community members to more easily find info & contribute. Content will be provided 
by the OBF board and community, with much of it directly copied from the [existing website](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page). 

###  Possible mentors  

- [Yo Yehudi](https://github.com/yochannah)
- Call for volunteers from the community?

## Design requirements and tasks

Design a home page for the OBF suitable for the site map below. 
This could be implemented by creating a custom Wordpress theme, 
although CMSes will be considered, so long as they have an easy-to-update-site
interface. Static site generators such as Jekyll or Hugo are not suitable.
